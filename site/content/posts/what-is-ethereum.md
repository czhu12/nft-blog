A blockchain is a decentralized database with a growing list of records chronologically chained from the oldest to the most recent. One of the most popular blockchains is **Ethereum**, which has a token called Ether (ETH) that can be used to pay for current goods and services if they are accepted, as well as for blockchain support work. Ethereum is the ideal technology platform for developing novel and cutting-edge applications, despite its general-purpose nature.

Vitalik Buterin, who published a white paper outlining Ethereum in 2014, is thought to have invented Ethereum. The Ethereum platform was introduced in 2015 by Buterin and Joe Lubin, the minds behind ConsenSys, a maker of blockchain software. 

The Ethereum platform has its blockchain, known as "the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)," which enables programmers to write, run, and evaluate code that runs on a user's computer or in the cloud. Other than this, the Ethereum blockchain was split into two distinct blockchains in 2016: one is used for ether (ETH), and the other is used for Ethereum Classic (ETC).

**The Mechanism of Ethereum**

Ethereum uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) methodology. A proof-of-stake (PoS) methodology is a framework by which, a network of users known as validators creates new blocks and collaborates to validate the data they contain. The blocks include data on the blockchain’s current state, a list of attestations (validators’ signatures and votes on the block’s validity), transactions, and much more. 

Staking 32 ETH is necessary for solo validators to activate their validation capability. Individuals can invest less ETH, but they must join a validation pool and split any rewards. Dishonest validators are sanctioned by having their staked ETH burned (sending cryptocurrency to a wallet without keys) and being kicked off from the network.

**Smart Contracts**

Decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts are two areas where Ethereum is often used. Simply put, smart contracts are computer programs that run on the Ethereum blockchain. They only operate when a user transaction initiates it (or another contract). They set Ethereum apart from other cryptocurrencies and give it a lot of flexibility in terms of what it can do. 

**Decentralized Autonomous Organizations** 

Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), which operate without central control, are a pioneering use case discovered by Ethereum developers. They are governed by software-coded regulations, and a group of stakeholders votes on the administration's choices. DAOs are still significant, despite being one of the first innovations tested on Ethereum. DAOs continue to be open-source and community-governed, even though the 2016 hack of the first Ethereum-based DAO was a turning point in the history of the blockchain. Today, several DAOs, such as MolochDAO and MetaCartel, function similarly to the original DAO by pooling user funds to give grants to Ethereum business owners.

**Ethereum Initial Coin Offerings** 

Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) are sales of tokens that function similarly to the traditional Initial Public Offering (IPO). Ethereum-enabled start-up fundraising significantly contributed to the rise of blockchain and cryptocurrencies in 2017 and 2018. The use of crowdsourcing by Ethereum in 2014 to fund the creation of its protocol was unique, but the ICO boom saw an explosion of token releases. This spike in investment for bitcoin firms indicated a fundamental change in the way creative entrepreneurs raise money.

**Enterprise Ethereum**

The term "Enterprise Ethereum" refers to specialized Ethereum-based networks and programs created for private businesses and organizations. Enterprise customers are in charge of the architecture, validators, and users since these networks have permissions. The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA), which currently has more than two hundred members and is testing private Ethereum versions for corporate usage, has attracted businesses including Samsung Group, J.P. Morgan, Mastercard, and Microsoft.

**Non-Fungible Tokens on Ethereum**

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are one-of-a-kind, irrevocable, and quantifiably rare digital assets that may be used for art, gaming, and tracing the origins of high-end commodities. The release of CryptoKitties digital cat collectibles on the Ethereum blockchain in late 2017 ignited the hype surrounding NFTs, but since then, the technology's potential uses have expanded quickly. NFTs have drawn a larger and larger segment of the public to cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Along with other stakeholders, the NBA, Ubisoft, and LVMH are also testing NFTs.

**Stablecoins**

Stablecoins are digital currency tokens that are backed by another asset, frequently fiat money. Some stablecoins also maintain their value through algorithms; others are supported by commodities like gold. A well-balanced mix of key cryptocurrencies also supports some stablecoins. Stablecoins are utilized in the cryptocurrency ecosystem as a reliable store of value, as insurance against price volatility for crypto traders, and as a stable, global currency, especially for those whose local fiat currency has lost value due to political or economic upheaval in their country. 

**Decentralized Finance**

The newest invention of Ethereum to experience a surge in usage and growth is decentralized finance (DeFi). Traditional financial services and products are being reimagined by DeFi platforms, which integrate programmable, censorship-resistant, and decentralized characteristics to provide whole new financial solutions.

**Ethereum & Bitcoin**

Ethereum has been dubbed "Bitcoin 2.0" due to its new system of cutting-edge cryptography and its open-source platform that is shared by all participants. In contrast to Bitcoin, which was created solely as a payment method, the Ethereum platform was founded to leverage blockchain technology for a wide range of applications. The way that the respective networks manage transaction processing fees is another important distinction between Ethereum and Bitcoin. On the Ethereum network, these charges are referred to as “gas” and are covered by the parties taking part in transactions, while the more exhaustive Bitcoin network covers transaction fees.



In this article, we have briefly covered Ethereum, its history, PoS, smart contracts, and its comparison with Bitcoin. It is impossible to cover everything in a single article as each component we have covered here deserves a separate article, so we will keep you updated about Ethereum in upcoming articles.
