The minting price of an NFT for your collection can be changed after your contract is deployed. Go to your management page to change the minting price.

Go to **Your Projects** → **Select Your Project** **→** **Deployment** → **Set Price**

*Note: You will need to pay gas fees for whatever blockchain you are deployed to in order to change the price for your collection.*
