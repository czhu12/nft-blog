A user can layer PNG and GIF images using our NFT artwork generator. JPG and JPEG images are not transparent, making it impossible for us to support them because layers cannot be created with them. We give designers an infinite number of layered design options by supporting multiple image formats, such as PNG and GIF. ﻿

## How does GIF layering work?

Your GIF layers must have the same number of frames or be multiples of one another in order for us to layer GIFs correctly.​ 

For example, 

* if you have one layer with a GIF that has **6 frames** and another layer that has a GIF with **6 frames**, then the final artwork will have **six frames.** 
* If you have one layer with a GIF that has **6 frames** and another layer that has a GIF with **12 frames**, then the final artwork will have **12 frames.** 
* If you have one layer with a GIF that has **6 frames** and another layer that has a GIF with **8 frames**, you will get an error because 6 and 8 are not proper multiples of each other.
