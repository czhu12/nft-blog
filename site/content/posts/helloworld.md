NFTs, which stand for "non-fungible tokens," are a blockchain record that confirms the ownership and uniqueness of digital assets. As long as they are NFTs, their individual values and ownership cannot be divided and traded. Since any $100 bill can be exchanged for another $100 bill, therefore, money is fungible. Each digital file is authenticated through a cryptographic transaction process, which also offers a digital signature to track NFT ownership. The NFT's ownership is tracked on a blockchain in the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) to prevent double spending.  

NFTs can track and represent the authenticity and ownership of physical assets, such as paintings, sculptures, and other original works of art, as well as digital assets in the forms of images, audios, videos, or other types. NFTs can be used extensively in the gaming and gambling sectors. Any artist can make NFT art using random NFT generators. Nowadays, NFT artists are a new and respected class of artists. NFT art can be put up for auction and sold on a dedicated marketplace.\

It is very difficult or impossible to create NFT digital art collections using traditional hand drawing or using general creation software, so at Mintables(.)Club, we developed our cutting-edge NFT generator studio to assist NFT enthusiasts and artists create NFT digital art collections in minutes. Layers and traits are typically created in order to produce the standard 10,000 NFT collections. 

**\
What are layers?**

Usually, NFT collections are created by layering several images together. The components of an image known as layers determine the typical shape of an NFT. In Bored Ape NFTs, the main character is a monkey with multiple layers, including a background, fur, mouth, hat (notice the tie), clothes, eyes, and an earring.

**\
What are traits?**

NFT traits are particular characteristics that every NFT possesses. If you look at the most well-known NFT on the market, Bored Ape Yacht Club, you'll see that traits are listed in the OpenSea description and typically have to do with the setting, body parts, eyes, clothing, and accessories.﻿

**\
What are rarities?**

NFT’s in a collection typically have different rarities based on the individual rarities of the traits. You can use our Rarity Editor to set the rarity of traits.﻿
