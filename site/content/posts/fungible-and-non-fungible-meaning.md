According to Merriam Webster, fungible is defined as "something (such as money or a commodity) of such a nature that one part or quantity may be replaced by another equal part or quantity in paying a debt or settling an account". Money from the aforementioned example is fungible because it can be used to exchange for goods and services. The aforementioned explanation best explains what is meant by the word "money," as it allows the owner of $1000 to buy a jacket if they suddenly decide they need one. Something that cannot be exchanged for goods or services is said to be non-fungible.\
\
Here's another illustration: Gold, cash, and bitcoins are all fungible. You won't mind if I use the first $100 bill in my pocket or the $100 bill I just took out of the bank to pay you back if I owe you $100. You won't mind if the bill is dirty or crumpled as long as it is a real bill, and you will accept it for its face value. The same rules apply when exchanging gold, silver, bitcoins, or other digital currencies. The market determines how much bitcoin is worth on any given day.\
\
They are all the same, which is what fungibility means. As an example, let's consider non-fungible tokens. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs), according to Investopedia, "...are cryptographic assets on a blockchain with unique identification codes and metadata that distinguish them from each other." Because each NFT is unique and there is only one in the entire world, they are valuable and sought after by NFT collectors.\

Let's examine some of the most well-known NFTs that have made history and are being sold for high ticket prices.\

**CryptoKitties**

The blockchain game CryptoKitties was launched on Ethereum in late November 2017. Dragon, which sold for 600 ETH, was one of the most expensive NFTs ever.﻿
