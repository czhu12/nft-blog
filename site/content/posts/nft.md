The world of technology is evolving day by day, from web 2 to web 3, from art to NFT…Maybe some people wonder, what exactly is this NFT thing? Let’s just try to give answers to some common queries including why people are crazy about NFT, whether NFT is a real revolution or just a bubble, how to generate an NFT, what it has for NFT creators etc. We made an honest effort to avoid technical hand-holding and difficult language to keep things simple.

**Art + Blockchain = NFT**

With distinct identifying codes and metadata (such as title, website, description, type of content, any giveaways, etc.) that can be sold and exchanged, a non-fungible token (NFT) is a non-transferable unit or cryptographic asset of data kept on a blockchain, a type of digital ledger. For instance, money is fungible because any $10 bill can be exchanged for another $10 bill. On the other hand, non-fungible assets are distinct and one of a kind. Each digital file is authenticated through this cryptographic transaction procedure, which also provides a digital signature that is used to monitor NFT ownership.

NFTs can be nearly anything, including a poem, song, movie scene, or photograph. They are valuable due to their rarity and authenticity. A unique way to invest in the web3, art, technology, and, as we like to say, the future is to collect an NFT!

Creating NFT Art provides a lot of doors and opportunities. For example, using the blockchain to reach a global audience, making ownership rights visible for investors and collectors, and facilitating direct communication without the use of centralized organizations. Any artist can make NFT art using random NFT generators. Nowadays, NFT artists are new and respected class of artists.

While the first NFT project, "Etheria," was launched in October 2015 on the Ethereum network, the first "NFT" Quantum, established by Kelvin McCoy and Anil Dash in May 2014, consisted of a video clip shot by McCoy's wife, and sold for $4 on the Namecoin platform. Naturally, NFT was unpopular at the time, and the majority of the 457 NFT pieces that were then listed on the Ethereum blockchain were left unsold for more than 5 years! 

A new craze for NFTs began in 2021, catching the attention of prominent celebrities such as Paris Hilton, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Grimes, and Cara Delevingne as well as artists, digital art collectors, businesses, and companies. Following the introduction of several NFT projects that year, the ERC-721 standard, which was first introduced via the Ethereum GitHub, is when the word "NFT" first became widely used. Large corporations are already utilizing NFTs because they recognize the potential in the market, including Coca-Cola, the NBA, and Louis Vuitton.

## How to Create A NFT Collection

Maybe after reading the previous section, you will become excited to create your NFT, but let’s just try to find the answers to some common questions before moving forward:

* Do I need to make an NFT? Perhaps your followers wish to view your work in a different light. However, that does not automatically imply that it should be an NFT. You should consider why you wish to do this. Is it because you’re curious about the blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and the communities that support them, or do you just like NFTs?
* Is it analogous to producing digital art? NFTs can be categorized as digital art in the blockchain.
* Does making an NFT require an understanding of blockchain? You must be aware of the advantages and disadvantages of the blockchain. No expertise is required. But you’ll get the most out of it if you grasp the fundamentals.

You can upload your incredible works of art on the blockchain once the above issues have been resolved. Use a no-code tool, such as the Mintables <https://www.mintables.club/>, as an NFT art generator. Without writing a single line of code, you can mint NFT art in huge numbers.

Simply upload your artwork. Then, you can control all collection variables, including rules and rarity, and auto-generate NFTs in a matter of minutes. By including their wallet addresses in your collection, you can easily ask others to contribute.

Making a smart contract is also not anything you need to be concerned about. With Mintables, you can easily create your tokens on the Ethereum network (you can forget about the crypto terms as well). Additionally, before deploying the smart contract, you may test your mint flow to make sure everything is operating as it should.   

## NFT Marketplace

After creating NFT, the big question is, where to visit for the NFT launch. Let us just try to answer this very common question. There are multiple NFT marketplaces, where you can buy/sell NFTs, some of them are as follows:

* OpenSea
* C﻿oinbase
* Rarible
* L﻿ooksRare
* S﻿uperRare
* N﻿ifty Gateway

## How to Attract Potential Buyers?

It can be a perfect fit if your traditional work reflects some touch to NFT collectors. If the content is truly valuable, there will be a market for it, just like there is for anything else of value. Put yourself in the position of your potential customers and consider what will seem most genuine to them. The worth may stem from your artistic identity or the topic you choose to portray. You can always experiment with both traditional and digital art to make NFT art for potential sales or gallery displays.

With web3, we are witnessing more innovative possibilities for creators to display their work, as well as for collectors to have a central location to view and appreciate their galleries in the metaverse. You can get ideas from projects like Spatial, Oncyber, Arium, Cryptovoxels, and Showtime.
