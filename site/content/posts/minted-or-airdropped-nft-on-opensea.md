# How long does it take for my minted or airdropped NFT to update on OpenSea?

All NFT’s created on Mintables by minting or airdropping should be viewable on OpenSea after the transaction is saved to the blockchain.

This normally will be less than 10 minutes, but sometimes, it can be longer depending on how much activity there is on the blockchain. Click on the **View on OpenSea** on a minted NFT to see the OpenSea link for it.

OpenSea integrates with Mintables by periodically checking the blockchain. You can force OpenSea to update the image by clicking on the **Refresh Metadata** button on the top right of your NFT.
